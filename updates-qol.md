This server-only update brings yet another round of additions and changes to the SMP. It focuses on the last few things I want to do for the server on the technical side but couldn't do it until now. To avoid dealing with Discord's message length limit and to also mark the two years anniversary of this website, the changelog will be here instead.

Without further yapping, let's get to it. Starting with more boring stuff first.

## Maintenance

### Automatic update

The server was able to automatically update all of its mods for a while now, but it can now do the same for Minecraft updates. If every baseline mods for the server has been updated to the latest version, the server will bump the Minecraft version by itself on the next maintenance reboot. This will decouple the update process from Quang's own schedule to speed things up in the end.

Baseline mods consist of those that add new features to the game's world such as Dungeons and Taverns, Geophilic, and Portfolio. The remainder mods will get disabled if its not yet compatible with the latest version of the game; it will re-enable itself once updated.

### Server configurations

As a server member, you're granted access to the server's Docker Compose file if you need to manually reboot the server or want to see how it's configured. Refer to the wiki for more information.

Unless you know what you're doing, you may not modify the compose file without prior permission. Misconfiguration can break the server.

## In-game

### Modded structure changes

To make Minecraft more fun to explore and feel less grindy, I continue to explore on how I can modify the world without making it too bloated. For this iteration, I have decided to remove the Explorify and Hearths mod and replace them with the following:
- [Structory](https://modrinth.com/datapack/structory)
- [Formations Nether](https://modrinth.com/mod/formations-nether)

These have less overlap with existing mods like Dungeons and Taverns while adding more lore to the game. You do want your world to feel alive. You're free to suggest on what else would you like to see on the server.

### Decorations

I've reintroduced the Portfolio mod, which adds more paintings to the game from the artist [Yapetto](https://bsky.app/profile/yptsh.bsky.social), that got accidentally removed. If you want more things to put in your house, you can [name stuff with anvils](https://modrinth.com/datapack/vanilla-plus-data-pack)!

### Voxy LOD streaming (workaround for slow chunks)

I'm aware that the server can get quite sluggish trying to load chunks on faster speed without the risk of hitting an invisible wall. I unfortunately can't improve it without switching to either [Pumpkin MC](https://pumpkinmc.org/) (not stable) or switch to a faster server (too broke). The best remedy available is to add [level of detail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)) (LOD) to the server. By installing [Voxy](https://modrinth.com/mod/voxy), you can see at greater rendering distance including chunks the server has not loaded yet.

As an added bonus, it allows you to see further with much less performance impact by employing the same technique seeing in modern open world video games.

### Bring your own paintings

You can now take any digital images you have and bring it into the server as a Minecraft painting. [The process](https://wiki.collegedebt.app/college-debt-smp/modded-features/custom-paintings) involves creating a custom painting resource pack with those images before uploading it to the server automatically via an automated system. You can make it high definition like the original image or have it be more pixelated like the one in the game.

## A custom modpack: Together Optimized

To make the process of using mods on the server more simple, I've decided to publish a custom modpack made specifically for the College Debt SMP that has all of the modded bells and whistles seen on the server's wiki bundled in. It has:
- All of the performance and visual enhancements seen in Fabulously Optimized.
- Simple Voice Chat for proximity voice chat and custom audio.
- Vivecraft for playing in VR or seeing others playing in VR.
- Voxy (mentioned earlier) for LOD.
- Nvidium and Reflex AntiLag for better performance on Nvidia GPU.

In a nutshell, it's a fork of Fabulously Optimized with all the server multiplayer stuff sprinkled in, and I've decided to call it **Together Optimized**. You can grab the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/College-Debt-SMP/together-optimized/releases) or from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpack/together-optimized). Installation process is the same as any other modpack.

As always, using this modpack or any other similar modpacks is not required for playing on the server besides adding more vibes to the server.
